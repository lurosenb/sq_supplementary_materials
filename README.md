# sq_supplementary_materials
Results from experiments conducted on SuperQUAIL method.

All results (i.e. pickled lists of real, synthetic data)/metrics generated (scores on classifiers, fair metrics on those classifiers) contained in the employment, mobility and public "results_metrics" folders. 

See `load_metrics` to load already generated metrics and replot, and `load_results` to load the lists of outputted synthetic data across runs and re-process them for metric generation.

NOTE: `load_results` takes a while to preprocess the runs.
